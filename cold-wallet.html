                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>The restaurant was a mistake. Leo knew it the moment Jessica walked in, her eyes doing a quick, unimpressed scan of the faux-fancy decor. He’d stretched his budget to the breaking point for this place, hoping to impress her, but the slightly-too-loud pop music and the laminated menus gave the game away. He was faking it.</p>

                    <p>"So," Jessica said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes as she settled into the booth. "Your profile said you were an 'entrepreneur'." The word hung in the air, weighted with skepticism.</p>

                    <p>"I'm working on a few things," Leo mumbled, tugging at the collar of his best, but still slightly frayed, shirt. "Freelance coding, some delivery driving on the side to keep the cash flow steady."</p>

                    <p>Her gaze was piercing. "I have to be honest, Leo. I'm at a point in my life, with two kids, where I need stability. I need a partner, not a project." Each word was a small, sharp jab at his already bruised ego. He saw his tiny apartment, the stack of bills on his counter, the constant, gnawing anxiety of the cost of living. He was drowning, and she was pointing out that he couldn't even afford a life raft for himself, let alone for anyone else.</p>

                    <p>The pressure built in his chest, a physical, suffocating weight. "Excuse me," he croaked, standing up abruptly. "I just need to use the restroom."</p>

                    <p>He splashed cold water on his face, staring at his own pathetic reflection in the mirror. He was 45, with a lifetime of bad bets and missed opportunities behind him. "Just one break," he whispered to the empty room, his voice cracking. "Just one wish. I'd do anything." He leaned his forehead against the cool tile, begging the universe for a do-over.</p>

                    <p>A toilet flushed in the stall behind him. Leo hadn't even realized someone else was there. A man in a sharp, impeccably tailored suit stepped out, washing his hands with a slow, deliberate calm. He didn't say a word, just gave Leo a strange, knowing look before exiting.</p>

                    <p>Shaken, Leo returned to his table. It was empty. Jessica was gone, and in her place on the table was the bill. $152.37. She’d left him with the tab. A hot flush of shame and anger washed over him. He paid with his nearly maxed-out credit card and walked out into the cool night air, too dejected to even pay for a bus fare.</p>

                    <p>He was halfway home, lost in a fog of self-loathing, when a sleek black car pulled up beside him. The window rolled down, revealing the man from the bathroom.</p>

                    <p>"A wish, I believe you said?" the man asked, his voice smooth and deep. "You'd do anything?"</p>

                    <p>Leo stared, bewildered. "Who are you?"</p>

                    <p>"A recruiter for second chances. An investor in potential," the man said with a thin smile. "I can give you what you want. A do-over. But it only works once. Make it count."</p>

                    <p>Leo didn't need to think. The regret was a physical thing, a stone in his gut. "I wish," he said, his voice raspy, "to go back to 2009. With everything I know now. Same body, same mind, just... earlier."</p>

                    <p>The man in the car grinned, a strange, inhuman light flickering in his eyes. "Done." The world dissolved into a screech of static.</p>

                    <p>Leo opened his eyes to the peeling paint of his childhood bedroom ceiling. He was 29 again. A flip phone, a relic, sat on his nightstand. A glance at a newspaper confirmed it: October 5th, 2009. It had worked. A frantic search online revealed what he already knew. Bitcoin. Genesis block mined, the network a ghost town, each coin worth less than a fraction of a penny.</p>

                    <p>A manic grin spread across his face. This was his second chance.</p>

                    <p>The next decade was a blur of relentless, joyless work. He took every job imaginable. He was a bartender, a night-shift security guard, a delivery driver, a freelance coder, and, when the service launched, an Uber driver. He worked 18-hour days, fueled by cheap coffee and the singular, burning vision of his future wealth.</p>

                    <p>He ghosted his friends. He stopped calling his parents, the conversations a distraction from the all-consuming goal. Girlfriends came and went, baffled by his obsessive frugality and his refusal to ever take a day off. "I'm building something," he'd mutter, his eyes distant. He poured every spare cent into Bitcoin, watching his digital wallet swell with thousands, then tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands of coins. He was a ghost in his own life, a man haunting the timeline for profit.</p>

                    <p>He did it. By the time the great crypto boom arrived, his cold wallet—a small, offline device he kept locked in a safe—held a fortune so vast it was almost abstract. Billions. He had won.</p>

                    <p>The day he decided to finally quit, to cash out a single coin and live like a king, he took one last Uber fare. A quick trip to the airport. Easy money. He was humming, a rare sound, as he merged onto the freeway. He never saw the semi that hydroplaned across three lanes of traffic.</p>

                    <p>Present Day. August 2, 2025.</p>

                    <p>The penthouse apartment was a sterile, white box overlooking the city. Its owner, Leo, saw none of it. He saw the world through a screen mounted to his state-of-the-art, voice-activated wheelchair. The crash had been catastrophic. He was a prisoner in his own body, paralyzed from the neck down, kept alive by a symphony of quiet, beeping machines.</p>

                    <p>The nurses were kind but distant. He had no friends, no family. They had all become ghosts of a past he had willingly sacrificed. His fortune was a cruel joke, a mountain of gold he couldn't touch, spend, or feel. It was just a number on a screen, as abstract as it had been when he was hoarding it.</p>

                    <p>Tears, hot and silent, streamed down his temples and into his hair. With a choked sob, he commanded his computer. "Search... search for charities. Cures for paralysis."</p>

                    <p>The screen filled with logos and donation links. He scrolled through them, his breath hitching, the sheer weight of his useless, magnificent wealth crushing him. He was the richest man in the cemetery.</p>

                    <p>Miles away, in a cramped, dimly lit apartment that smelled of stale pizza and despair, a young man named Sam stared at his own reflection in the dark screen of his laptop. Another rejection email. Another bill he couldn't pay.</p>

                    <p>He sighed, running a hand through his greasy hair. He clicked on a news article about a mysterious crypto billionaire who had just donated a record-shattering sum to medical research.</p>

                    <p>"Must be nice," Sam muttered to the empty room, his voice thick with envy. He leaned back, closing his eyes, and whispered the most potent, dangerous words he could conjure.</p>

                    <p>"Man, I wish I could go back in time and buy Bitcoin."</p>
