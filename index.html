          <div class="story-content">
            <p>
              The flickering blue light of the television cast long, distorted
              shadows across the cramped living room. Leo, perpetually slouched
              in his worn armchair, chewed on a hangnail, his eyes glued to the
              screen. Across from him, perched on the edge of a stained sofa,
              sat Mark, a man whose nervous energy could power a small city.
              Their ritual was as old as their friendship: a shared love for
              baseball, a shared addiction to the online sportsbook, and a
              shared, nagging frustration.
            </p>

            <p>
              "He's up, he's up!" Mark practically shrieked, pointing a
              trembling finger at the TV. "This is it, Leo! Bottom of the ninth,
              bases loaded, two outs! If he hits a single, we're golden!"
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo grunted, his gaze fixed on his own phone, where the betting
              app displayed the odds. "Yeah, yeah. Just wait for my stream to
              catch up. Yours is always three minutes ahead, you know that."
            </p>

            <p>
              It was their constant bane. Mark's internet connection,
              inexplicably faster, always gave him a glimpse of the immediate
              future, a cruel tease in the high-stakes world of live betting. By
              the time Leo's stream showed the pitch, the odds had shifted, the
              opportunity often gone. They'd lost countless small fortunes to
              this digital time lag.
            </p>

            <p>
              "This is ridiculous," Leo sighed, leaning back. "We're missing out
              on serious money. We need to be *there*. In the stadium. Where the
              action is real-time."
            </p>

            <p>
              Mark's eyes widened. "You mean... a game? A live game? And the
              sportsbook?"
            </p>

            <p>
              "Exactly," Leo said, a rare glint of ambition in his tired eyes.
              "No more delays. Just us, the game, and the pure, unadulterated
              thrill of the live bet."
            </p>

            <p>
              It was a splurge they couldn't truly afford, but the dream of
              unfettered gambling, of finally beating the system, was too
              enticing. They booked tickets for a prime-time game, splurged on a
              hotel room overlooking the city skyline, and packed their meager
              savings, ready to conquer the live odds.
            </p>

            <p>
              The stadium hummed with electric anticipation. The crack of the
              bat, the roar of the crowd – it was intoxicating. They settled
              into their seats, the sportsbook app open on their phones, ready
              to place their first live wager.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Okay, top of the third," Mark muttered, adjusting his cap.
              "Pitcher looks shaky. I'm thinking a walk here. Odds are good."
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo nodded, about to confirm the bet, when Mark suddenly froze,
              his eyes glued to his phone screen. "No... no way."
            </p>

            <p>"What is it?" Leo leaned closer.</p>

            <p>
              Mark's phone, usually a mirror of the live game, was displaying
              something impossible. The score, the inning, the number of outs –
              it was all updated. But the play hadn't happened yet. On the
              field, the pitcher was still winding up. On Mark's phone, the
              batter had already walked.
            </p>

            <p>
              "It's... it's showing the future," Mark whispered, his voice a
              mixture of terror and awe. "Before it happens. Look! It says the
              next batter strikes out, and then a double play ends the inning!"
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo snatched the phone. His heart hammered against his ribs. It
              was true. The digital scoreboard on the phone was a few seconds,
              perhaps a minute, ahead of reality. It wasn't a stream delay; it
              was a *future* feed.
            </p>

            <p>
              A wild, exhilarating grin spread across Leo's face. "Mark... do
              you know what this means?"
            </p>

            <p>
              Their first few bets were tentative, almost disbelieving. They
              placed small wagers based on the phone's prophetic updates: a
              strikeout here, a base hit there. Each time, the phone was right.
              The future unfolded precisely as predicted on the glowing screen.
            </p>

            <p>
              Confidence swelled, then arrogance. They moved to bigger bets,
              then even bigger. The sportsbook tellers, initially amused by
              their luck, began to eye them with suspicion, then grudging
              respect. The numbers on their betting accounts soared,
              transforming from modest sums into five, then six figures. They
              were invincible. They were gods of the game.
            </p>

            <p>
              The hotel room, once a symbol of their splurge, became a war room.
              Stacks of cash, crisp and new, lay scattered across the bed.
              Champagne bottles, empty and discarded, littered the floor. Their
              laughter echoed through the night, a symphony of triumph.
            </p>

            <p>
              "This is it, Leo!" Mark exclaimed, his eyes gleaming with a manic
              fervor. "Bottom of the ninth, bases loaded again! But this time...
              this time it's for everything! The phone says grand slam! A grand
              slam, Leo! Millions!"
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo stared at the phone, then at the mountain of money. A tremor
              of unease ran through him. "Millions, Mark? Are you sure? We have
              so much already. We could walk away, set for life."
            </p>

            <p>
              "Walk away?" Mark scoffed, his face contorted by greed. "And leave
              this on the table? Are you insane? This is our destiny! The phone
              has never been wrong!"
            </p>

            <p>
              Their argument escalated, voices rising, accusations flying. The
              bond of friendship, once unbreakable, frayed under the immense
              pressure of their ill-gotten gains. They clawed at each other, not
              physically, but with words, each trying to assert dominance over
              their shared, miraculous secret.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, Leo, his mind clouded by the intoxicating allure of
              ultimate wealth, relented. "Fine! Millions it is! One last bet.
              All or nothing!"
            </p>

            <p>
              They rushed back to the stadium, the final inning underway. The
              tension was palpable. The phone glowed in Mark's hand, displaying
              the glorious, impossible future: a grand slam, a victory, and a
              fortune beyond their wildest dreams.
            </p>

            <p>
              They placed the bet, every last cent they possessed, on the grand
              slam. The ball was pitched. The crowd roared. The batter swung.
            </p>

            <p>
              A sharp, sickening crack. The ball soared. Leo and Mark watched,
              their breath caught in their throats, as it arced towards the
              outfield.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then, a sudden, jarring flicker on Mark's phone. The screen
              glitched, pixels dancing erratically. The future score, the grand
              slam, vanished, replaced by a frozen image of the batter,
              mid-swing. The app crashed.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the field, the ball, instead of clearing the fence, veered
              sharply foul, a mere foot from the stands. The crowd groaned. The
              batter, frustrated, struck out on the next pitch. The game ended,
              not with a grand slam, but with a whimper.
            </p>

            <p>
              Their fortune, their friendship, their sanity – all gone in a
              single, cruel moment. The phone, once their oracle, now lay inert,
              a useless slab of metal and glass.
            </p>

            <p>
              They stood there amidst the departing crowd, two broken men, their
              faces etched with disbelief and a horrifying realization. The
              universe, in its infinite, ironic wisdom, had granted them a
              glimpse behind the curtain, only to snatch it away when their
              greed became too great. They had been given the power to see the
              future, but not the wisdom to know when to stop.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the stadium lights dimmed, casting them into deeper shadow, Leo
              turned to Mark, his eyes burning with a cold, unforgiving fury.
              "You," he hissed, "You and your damn phone."
            </p>

            <p>
              Mark, his face pale and contorted, lunged. The fight that ensued
              was not about money, but about the bitter, crushing weight of what
              they had lost, and the chilling truth that some secrets are best
              left undisturbed.
            </p>

            <p>
              For in the twilight zone of human desire, the greatest gamble is
              often not against the odds, but against the very nature of fate
              itself. And sometimes, the future is best left unseen, lest its
              fleeting promise lead you down a path from which there is no
              return.
