          <div class="story-content">
            <p>
              The flickering blue light of the television cast long, distorted
              shadows across the cramped living room. Leo, perpetually slouched
              in his worn armchair, chewed on a hangnail, his eyes glued to the
              screen. Across from him, perched on the edge of a stained sofa,
              sat Mark, a man whose nervous energy could power a small city.
              Their ritual was as old as their friendship: a shared love for
              baseball, a shared addiction to the online sportsbook, and a
              shared, nagging frustration.
            </p>

            <p>
              "He's up, he's up!" Mark practically shrieked, pointing a
              trembling finger at the TV. "This is it, Leo! Bottom of the ninth,
              bases loaded, two outs! If he hits a single, we're golden!"
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo grunted, his gaze fixed on his own phone, where the betting
              app displayed the odds. "Yeah, yeah. Just wait for my stream to
              catch up. Yours is always three minutes ahead, you know that."
            </p>

            <p>
              It was their constant bane. Mark's internet connection,
              inexplicably faster, always gave him a glimpse of the immediate
              future, a cruel tease in the high-stakes world of live betting. By
              the time Leo's stream showed the pitch, the odds had shifted, the
              opportunity often gone. They'd lost countless small fortunes to
              this digital time lag.
            </p>

            <p>
              "This is ridiculous," Leo sighed, leaning back. "We're missing out
              on serious money. We need to be *there*. In the stadium. Where the
              action is real-time."
            </p>

            <p>
              Mark's eyes widened. "You mean... a game? A live game? And the
              sportsbook?"
            </p>

            <p>
              "Exactly," Leo said, a rare glint of ambition in his tired eyes.
              "No more delays. Just us, the game, and the pure, unadulterated
              thrill of the live bet."
            </p>

            <p>
              It was a splurge they couldn't truly afford, but the dream of
              unfettered gambling, of finally beating the system, was too
              enticing. They booked tickets for a prime-time game, splurged on a
              hotel room overlooking the city skyline, and packed their meager
              savings, ready to conquer the live odds.
            </p>

            <p>
              The stadium hummed with electric anticipation. The crack of the
              bat, the roar of the crowd – it was intoxicating. They settled
              into their seats, the sportsbook app open on their phones, ready
              to place their first live wager.
            </p>

            <p>
              "Okay, top of the third," Mark muttered, adjusting his cap.
              "Pitcher looks shaky. I'm thinking a walk here. Odds are good."
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo nodded, about to confirm the bet, when Mark suddenly froze,
              his eyes glued to his phone screen. "No... no way."
            </p>

            <p>"What is it?" Leo leaned closer.</p>

            <p>
              Mark's phone, usually a mirror of the live game, was displaying
              something impossible. The score, the inning, the number of outs –
              it was all updated. But the play hadn't happened yet. On the
              field, the pitcher was still winding up. On Mark's phone, the
              batter had already walked.
            </p>

            <p>
              "It's... it's showing the future," Mark whispered, his voice a
              mixture of terror and awe. "Before it happens. Look! It says the
              next batter strikes out, and then a double play ends the inning!"
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo snatched the phone. His heart hammered against his ribs. It
              was true. The digital scoreboard on the phone was a few seconds,
              perhaps a minute, ahead of reality. It wasn't a stream delay; it
              was a *future* feed.
            </p>

            <p>
              A wild, exhilarating grin spread across Leo's face. "Mark... do
              you know what this means?"
            </p>

            <p>
              Their first few bets were tentative, almost disbelieving. They
              placed small wagers based on the phone's prophetic updates: a
              strikeout here, a base hit there. Each time, the phone was right.
              The future unfolded precisely as predicted on the glowing screen.
            </p>

            <p>
              Confidence swelled, then arrogance. They moved to bigger bets,
              then even bigger. The sportsbook tellers, initially amused by
              their luck, began to eye them with suspicion, then grudging
              respect. The numbers on their betting accounts soared,
              transforming from modest sums into five, then six figures. They
              were invincible. They were gods of the game.
            </p>

            <p>
              The hotel room, once a symbol of their splurge, became a war room.
              Stacks of cash, crisp and new, lay scattered across the bed.
              Champagne bottles, empty and discarded, littered the floor. Their
              laughter echoed through the night, a symphony of triumph.
            </p>

            <p>
              "This is it, Leo!" Mark exclaimed, his eyes gleaming with a manic
              fervor. "Bottom of the ninth, bases loaded again! But this time...
              this time it's for everything! The phone says grand slam! A grand
              slam, Leo! Millions!"
            </p>

            <p>
              Leo stared at the phone, then at the mountain of money. A tremor
              of unease ran through him. "Millions, Mark? Are you sure? We have
              so much already. We could walk away, set for life."
            </p>

            <p>
              "Walk away?" Mark scoffed, his face contorted by greed. "And leave
              this on the table? Are you insane? This is our destiny! The phone
              has never been wrong!"
            </p>

            <p>
              Their argument escalated, voices rising, accusations flying. The
              bond of friendship, once unbreakable, frayed under the immense
              pressure of their ill-gotten gains. They clawed at each other, not
              physically, but with words, each trying to assert dominance over
              their shared, miraculous secret.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, Leo, his mind clouded by the intoxicating allure of
              ultimate wealth, relented. "Fine! Millions it is! One last bet.
              All or nothing!"
            </p>

            <p>
              They rushed back to the stadium, the final inning underway. The
              tension was palpable. The phone glowed in Mark's hand, displaying
              the glorious, impossible future: a grand slam, a victory, and a
              fortune beyond their wildest dreams.
            </p>

            <p>
              They placed the bet, every last cent they possessed, on the grand
              slam. The ball was pitched. The crowd roared. The batter swung.
            </p>

            <p>
              A sharp, sickening crack. The ball soared. Leo and Mark watched,
              their breath caught in their throats, as it arced towards the
              outfield.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then, a sudden, jarring flicker on Mark's phone. The screen
              glitched, pixels dancing erratically. The future score, the grand
              slam, vanished, replaced by a frozen image of the batter,
              mid-swing. The app crashed.
            </p>

            <p>
              On the field, the ball, instead of clearing the fence, veered
              sharply foul, a mere foot from the stands. The crowd groaned. The
              batter, frustrated, struck out on the next pitch. The game ended,
              not with a grand slam, but with a whimper.
            </p>

            <p>
              Their fortune, their friendship, their sanity – all gone in a
              single, cruel moment. The phone, once their oracle, now lay inert,
              a useless slab of metal and glass.
            </p>

            <p>
              They stood there amidst the departing crowd, two broken men, their
              faces etched with disbelief and a horrifying realization. The
              universe, in its infinite, ironic wisdom, had granted them a
              glimpse behind the curtain, only to snatch it away when their
              greed became too great. They had been given the power to see the
              future, but not the wisdom to know when to stop.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the stadium lights dimmed, casting them into deeper shadow, Leo
              turned to Mark, his eyes burning with a cold, unforgiving fury.
              "You," he hissed, "You and your damn phone."
            </p>

            <p>
              Mark, his face pale and contorted, lunged. The fight that ensued
              was not about money, but about the bitter, crushing weight of what
              they had lost, and the chilling truth that some secrets are best
              left undisturbed.
            </p>

            <p>
              For in the twilight zone of human desire, the greatest gamble is
              often not against the odds, but against the very nature of fate
              itself. And sometimes, the future is best left unseen, lest its
              fleeting promise lead you down a path from which there is no
              return.
            </p>

                    <p>The restaurant was a mistake. Leo knew it the moment Jessica walked in, her eyes doing a quick, unimpressed scan of the faux-fancy decor. He’d stretched his budget to the breaking point for this place, hoping to impress her, but the slightly-too-loud pop music and the laminated menus gave the game away. He was faking it.</p>

                    <p>"So," Jessica said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes as she settled into the booth. "Your profile said you were an 'entrepreneur'." The word hung in the air, weighted with skepticism.</p>

                    <p>"I'm working on a few things," Leo mumbled, tugging at the collar of his best, but still slightly frayed, shirt. "Freelance coding, some delivery driving on the side to keep the cash flow steady."</p>

                    <p>Her gaze was piercing. "I have to be honest, Leo. I'm at a point in my life, with two kids, where I need stability. I need a partner, not a project." Each word was a small, sharp jab at his already bruised ego. He saw his tiny apartment, the stack of bills on his counter, the constant, gnawing anxiety of the cost of living. He was drowning, and she was pointing out that he couldn't even afford a life raft for himself, let alone for anyone else.</p>

                    <p>The pressure built in his chest, a physical, suffocating weight. "Excuse me," he croaked, standing up abruptly. "I just need to use the restroom."</p>

                    <p>He splashed cold water on his face, staring at his own pathetic reflection in the mirror. He was 45, with a lifetime of bad bets and missed opportunities behind him. "Just one break," he whispered to the empty room, his voice cracking. "Just one wish. I'd do anything." He leaned his forehead against the cool tile, begging the universe for a do-over.</p>

                    <p>A toilet flushed in the stall behind him. Leo hadn't even realized someone else was there. A man in a sharp, impeccably tailored suit stepped out, washing his hands with a slow, deliberate calm. He didn't say a word, just gave Leo a strange, knowing look before exiting.</p>

                    <p>Shaken, Leo returned to his table. It was empty. Jessica was gone, and in her place on the table was the bill. $152.37. She’d left him with the tab. A hot flush of shame and anger washed over him. He paid with his nearly maxed-out credit card and walked out into the cool night air, too dejected to even pay for a bus fare.</p>

                    <p>He was halfway home, lost in a fog of self-loathing, when a sleek black car pulled up beside him. The window rolled down, revealing the man from the bathroom.</p>

                    <p>"A wish, I believe you said?" the man asked, his voice smooth and deep. "You'd do anything?"</p>

                    <p>Leo stared, bewildered. "Who are you?"</p>

                    <p>"A recruiter for second chances. An investor in potential," the man said with a thin smile. "I can give you what you want. A do-over. But it only works once. Make it count."</p>

                    <p>Leo didn't need to think. The regret was a physical thing, a stone in his gut. "I wish," he said, his voice raspy, "to go back to 2009. With everything I know now. Same body, same mind, just... earlier."</p>

                    <p>The man in the car grinned, a strange, inhuman light flickering in his eyes. "Done." The world dissolved into a screech of static.</p>

                    <p>Leo opened his eyes to the peeling paint of his childhood bedroom ceiling. He was 29 again. A flip phone, a relic, sat on his nightstand. A glance at a newspaper confirmed it: October 5th, 2009. It had worked. A frantic search online revealed what he already knew. Bitcoin. Genesis block mined, the network a ghost town, each coin worth less than a fraction of a penny.</p>

                    <p>A manic grin spread across his face. This was his second chance.</p>

                    <p>The next decade was a blur of relentless, joyless work. He took every job imaginable. He was a bartender, a night-shift security guard, a delivery driver, a freelance coder, and, when the service launched, an Uber driver. He worked 18-hour days, fueled by cheap coffee and the singular, burning vision of his future wealth.</p>

                    <p>He ghosted his friends. He stopped calling his parents, the conversations a distraction from the all-consuming goal. Girlfriends came and went, baffled by his obsessive frugality and his refusal to ever take a day off. "I'm building something," he'd mutter, his eyes distant. He poured every spare cent into Bitcoin, watching his digital wallet swell with thousands, then tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands of coins. He was a ghost in his own life, a man haunting the timeline for profit.</p>

                    <p>He did it. By the time the great crypto boom arrived, his cold wallet—a small, offline device he kept locked in a safe—held a fortune so vast it was almost abstract. Billions. He had won.</p>

                    <p>The day he decided to finally quit, to cash out a single coin and live like a king, he took one last Uber fare. A quick trip to the airport. Easy money. He was humming, a rare sound, as he merged onto the freeway. He never saw the semi that hydroplaned across three lanes of traffic.</p>

                    <p>Present Day. August 2, 2025.</p>

                    <p>The penthouse apartment was a sterile, white box overlooking the city. Its owner, Leo, saw none of it. He saw the world through a screen mounted to his state-of-the-art, voice-activated wheelchair. The crash had been catastrophic. He was a prisoner in his own body, paralyzed from the neck down, kept alive by a symphony of quiet, beeping machines.</p>

                    <p>The nurses were kind but distant. He had no friends, no family. They had all become ghosts of a past he had willingly sacrificed. His fortune was a cruel joke, a mountain of gold he couldn't touch, spend, or feel. It was just a number on a screen, as abstract as it had been when he was hoarding it.</p>

                    <p>Tears, hot and silent, streamed down his temples and into his hair. With a choked sob, he commanded his computer. "Search... search for charities. Cures for paralysis."</p>

                    <p>The screen filled with logos and donation links. He scrolled through them, his breath hitching, the sheer weight of his useless, magnificent wealth crushing him. He was the richest man in the cemetery.</p>

                    <p>Miles away, in a cramped, dimly lit apartment that smelled of stale pizza and despair, a young man named Sam stared at his own reflection in the dark screen of his laptop. Another rejection email. Another bill he couldn't pay.</p>

                    <p>He sighed, running a hand through his greasy hair. He clicked on a news article about a mysterious crypto billionaire who had just donated a record-shattering sum to medical research.</p>

                    <p>"Must be nice," Sam muttered to the empty room, his voice thick with envy. He leaned back, closing his eyes, and whispered the most potent, dangerous words he could conjure.</p>

                    <p>"Man, I wish I could go back in time and buy Bitcoin."</p>
